QuickThreads 003: Changes since QuickThreads 002.

 - Rename library `libqt.a' to `libquickthreads.h' to avoid conflicts
   with the Trolltech "qt" library.  There are apparently applications
   which use both.
 - Rename .h to "quickthreads.h" and "quickthreadsmd.h" to be consistent.
 - Supports PowerPC (at long last; many thanks to the contirbutors).
 - Cleanups and style changes for transfer to Free Software Foundation.

QuickThreads 002: Changes since QuickThreads 001.

 - Now can be used by C++ programs.
 - Now *really* works with stacks that grow up.
 - Supports AXP OSF 2.x cc's varargs.
 - Supports HP Precision (HP-PA) on workstations and Convex.
 - Supports assemblers for Intel iX86 ith only '//'-style comments.
 - Supports Silicon Graphics Irix 5.x with dynamic linking.
 - Supports System V and Solaris 2.x with no `_' on compiler-generated
   identifiers; *some* platforms only.

Note: not all "./config" arguments are compatible with QT 001.
